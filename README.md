## How it works

In simple words :)

Each `VisitorAgent` receives a menu from the `ManagerAgent`,
chooses a random dish and requests the creation of an order.

## Usage

To run project (with existing `.jar`):
```bash
make run
```

To rebuild project:
```bash
make build
```

To check format (btw this is checked in CI):
```bash
make lint
```
